# Introduction

A Linux filesystem separates:
| Component | Stores What? |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Inode** | Metadata about the file |
| **Data Blocks** | Actual file contents |

## Simple Explanation

Think of it like this:
| Real Life Example | Linux Equivalent |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Library catalog card | Inode |
| Actual book pages | Data blocks |
The catalog card tells you:

- who owns the book
- size
- location
- timestamps
- permissions

But the actual text of the book is stored elsewhere.

In Linux, every file and directory has an **inode**.
An inode is a special data structure that stores:

- File permissions
- Owner
- Group
- File size
- Timestamps
- Pointers to data blocks

> ⚠️ Important:
>
> Inodes DO NOT store the filename itself.

- The filename exists inside the **directory entry**, which points to an inode number.

The filename exists inside the directory entry.

Example:
| Filename | Inode |
| ---------- | ------- |
| report.txt | 3470012 |

The directory maps:

```
report.txt  → inode 3470012
```

Then Linux reads inode 3470012, which points to the actual datablocks.

## Practice Task

Run the following command:

```bash
echo "hello" > file1
```

Linux creates:\
Directory Entry
| Filename | Inode |
| -------- | ----- |
| file1 | 5001 |

Inode 5001 now Stores the following:

```
Owner: root
Permissions: rw-r--r--
Size: 6 bytes
Data block pointer: 9021
Data Block 9021
```

Data Block 9021 Contains:

```
hello
```

At this stage you should be very clear in your understanding of inodes. Let us now Run commands and Practice

# Task 1 - Checking Inodes with `ls -li`

Run the following command:

```bash
ls -li /var
```

Example Output:

```bash
3470012 drwxr-xr-x. 20 root root 4096 May 20 10:00 log
3470013 drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root 4096 May 20 10:00 tmp
3470014 drwxr-xr-x.  5 root root 4096 May 20 10:00 spool
```

---

## Explanation

| Field     | Meaning      |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 3470012   | Inode number |
| d         | Directory    |
| rwxr-xr-x | Permissions  |
| root      | Owner        |
| root      | Group        |
| 4096      | Size         |
| log       | Filename     |

---

## Key Learning

Linux first reads the directory contents:

```bash
cd /var
ls -l
```

The directory contains:

| Filename | Inode   |
| -------- | ------- |
| log      | 3470012 |
| tmp      | 3470013 |
| spool    | 3470014 |

Linux then uses the inode number to locate the metadata and file blocks on disk.

---

# Task 2 - Understanding Directory Metadata with `ls -ld`

Run:

```bash
ls -ld /
```

Example Output:

```
dr-xr-xr-x. 22 root root 287 Jul 28 01:23 /
```

---

# What Does "287" Mean?

It means:

```
The '/' - root directory currently needs 287 bytes to store its list of filenames and inode mappings.
```

It DOES NOT mean:

- total size of all files inside `/`
- filesystem size
- used disk space

---

# Simple Explanation

Think of a directory like a:

📒 **Phone Book**

The directory only stores:

- filenames
- inode numbers

Example:

| Filename | Inode |
| -------- | ----- |
| etc      | 1200  |
| var      | 1201  |
| home     | 1202  |

The actual file data exists elsewhere on disk.

---

# Important Clarification

Linux filesystems use different block sizes:

- 1 KB
- 2 KB
- 4 KB
- sometimes larger

You can check block size using:

```bash
stat -f /
```

or

```bash
dumpe2fs /dev/sdaX | grep "Block size"
```

---

# Better Explanation

The value:

```text
287
```

simply means:

> The directory metadata currently occupies 287 bytes.

As more files/directories are added inside `/`, this directory size can grow.

---

# Task 3 - Comparing `ls -l` vs `ls -ld`

## Command 1

```bash
ls -l /
```

This shows:

✅ Metadata of CONTENTS INSIDE `/`

---

## Command 2

```bash
ls -ld /
```

This shows:

✅ Metadata of the `/` directory ITSELF

---

## Command 3

```bash
ls -li /
```

Shows:

✅ Inode numbers + metadata

---

## Command 4

```bash
ls -ild /
```

Shows:

✅ Inode number of `/` itself

---

# Task 4 - Checking Filesystem Inode Usage

Run:

```bash
df -i
```

Example:

```bash
Filesystem      Inodes  IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/sda1      655360 655360       0  100% /
```

# INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

When a user checks a VM's Linux file system (Hint: Using df -h) it shows the user that 20G of Disk Space is Available. When the user tries to create a new file (Hint: using 'touch' command) the system is not able to create a new file. What is the root cause of this problem?

Run this command to show free disk space:

```bash
df -h
```

shows free disk space:

```bash
20G available
```

Why are users unable to ceate files.

Because:

❌ All inodes are used.

---

# Very Important Concept

A filesystem has:

| Resource    | Purpose                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Disk blocks | Store actual file data               |
| Inodes      | Store metadata for files/directories |

You need BOTH available:

- ✅ Free blocks
- ✅ Free inodes

---

# Example

Imagine:

- You create 5 million tiny log files
- Each file is only 1 byte

Result:

- Very little disk space used
- BUT millions of inodes consumed

Eventually:

```bash
No space left on device
```

even though:

```bash
df -h
```

shows free space.

---

# Task 5 - Creating Files and Watching Inodes Change

Create practice directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/inode_lab
cd ~/inode_lab
```

Create files:

```bash
touch file1
touch file2
touch file3
```

Check inode numbers:

```bash
ls -li
```

Example:

```bash
3475001 file1
3475002 file2
3475003 file3
```

---

# Delete a File

```bash
rm file2
```

Create another:

```bash
touch newfile
```

Check again:

```bash
ls -li
```

Observe:

✅ Linux may reuse freed inode numbers.

---

# Task 6 - Important Concepts Explained

# Are Inodes Fixed?

✅ YES.

When a filesystem is created:

```bash
mkfs.ext4
```

Linux pre-allocates a fixed number of inodes.

---

# Why?

Because Linux must reserve space for inode tables ahead of time.

---

# Can You Increase Inodes Later?

Usually:

❌ No (not easily)

You normally recreate the filesystem with different inode settings.

---

# Where Are Inodes Stored?

Inodes are stored in special filesystem structures called:

```text
inode tables
```

These are created when the filesystem is formatted.

| Filename       | Stored in directory entry    |
| Directory      | Maps names to inode numbers  |
| Disk Blocks    | Store actual data            |
| `df -h`        | Shows block usage            |
| `df -i`        | Shows inode usage            |
| No free inodes | Cannot create files          |
| `ls -ld /`     | Shows metadata of `/` itself |

# Practice Questions

1. What does an inode store?
2. Does an inode store the filename?
3. What is the difference between `ls -l /` and `ls -ld /`?
4. Why can a system run out of inodes?
5. What command shows inode usage?
6. Why can `df -h` show free space but file creation still fail?

---

# Final Summary

Run:

```bash
stat /etc/passwd
```

Identify:

- inode number
- timestamps
- permissions
- size
- owner
